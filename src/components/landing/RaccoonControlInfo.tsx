                                    Handling raccoons requires respect for the animal and the legal requirements of Florida wildlife laws. Our team is fully licensed and insured to provide humane trapping and relocation services that comply with all local regulations.
                                </p>

                                    Beyond just removal, we specialize in "entry-point exclusion." We don't just take the raccoon away; we ensure that no other animal can take its place by reinforcing your home's weak spots.
